# Roles

Roles are multi-assignable user groups. Roles can inherit the permissions of other roles. The structure of a role looks like so:

```hocon
roleID {
  name: Role Name
  type: GUEST | USER | STAFF
  default: true | false
  inherits: [ roleID, ... ]
  badges: [
    {
      name: Badge Name
      tooltip: Badge Tooltip
      type: text | icon
      cssIcon: fas fa-icon-name
    }
  ]
  permissions: [
    permission.node
  ]
}
```
