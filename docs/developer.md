# Developer Documentation

This file serves as a mini-documentation for a small set features in `pxls.js`, for use either in either internal or external development (such as userscripts).

All components are accessible via `self` internally, or `App` externally. For the sake of the examples provided here, we will be using `App`.

## Templating

Templating is already provided via URL parameters, but is easily modifiable via scripts.
For that there is `App.updateTemplate()`. It works by passing a template-object as an argument. A full template object looks like the following:

```js
App.updateTemplate({
    use: true, // boolean, whether to use the template or not
    url: 'https://example.com/image.png', // string, url of image
    x: 5, // float, x-position of image
    y: 42, // float, y-position of image
    width: 7, // float, width of image, if scaling is desired
    opacity: 0.5, // float, opacity, 0 min, 1 max
});
```

You can omit keys if wanted:

```js
// initialize the template
App.updateTemplate({
    use: true,
    url: 'https://example.com/image.png',
    x: 1337,
    y: 3
});

// ...

// hide the template
App.updateTemplate({ opacity: 0 });

// ...

// show the template
App.updateTemplate({ opacity: 1 });
```

Note that if `use` is set to `false`, previous parameters will be forgotten.
It's best to assign the template data to an object and supply that, or set `opacity` to hide it.

## Storage

We also provide storage wrappers for `localStorage` (`ls`) and `sessionStorage` (`ss`).
Both have a fallback to cookies, 99-days or session-cookies, depending on the type of storage.

It is possible to store anything that can be expressed via JSON.

```js
App.ls.set('blah', 42); // sets 'blah' to 42
App.ls.get('blah'); // 42
App.ls.set('blah', { a: 'b' }); // sets 'blah' to the object
App.ls.get('blah'); // { a: 'b' }
App.ls.remove('blah');
App.ls.get('blah'); // undefined
```

## Settings

It is possible to change settings using the settings object in a program-friendly way.
Using the following functions will cause the changes to be reflected internally as well as update settings controls to reflect new values.

```js
App.settings.board.heatmap.enable.set(true); // enable the heatmap
App.settings.ui.cursor.enable.toggle(); // enable/disable the cursor
App.settings.board.zoom.sensitivity.set(2); // set the zoom sensitivity
App.settings.audio.alert.volume.get(); // returns the current alert volume
```

The various settings keys can be found in-code or through a browser auto-complete if needed.
They will generally be named like this: `component.feature.subfeature.setting`.

Also note that the `.toggle()` function is only available for boolean settings (usually those ending in `.enable`).

## Lookup Hooks

Hooks are objects that provide extra functionality for lookups.
In the example, `data` supplied to `get` would be lookup information, while properties in `css` are assigned to their values.

```js
App.lookup.registerHook({
    id: "rebel_hook",
    name: "Rebellious Hook",
    get: data => `Hehehe... the X is ${data.x} and Y is ${data.y}...`,
    css: {
        color: "yellow",
    },
});
```

Your function's return value can either be a jQuery object, a string (later wrapped in a `span`), or null (signaling the hook shouldn't be included).

## Chat Hooks

Similar to lookup hooks, hooks can also be used to intercept chat messages and highlight messages the same way a ping does.

Below is an example of a hook that would make every message a ping.
In it, `data` supplied to `get` would be message information.
This data contains `message_raw` which is the raw text of the message as well as other values such as `author`, `date` and more.

```js
App.chat.registerHook({
    id: "annoying_hook",
    get: data => ({
        pings: [
            {
                start: 0,
                length: data.message_raw.length,
                highlight: false
            }
        ]
    })
});
```

Your function's return value should be an object containing an array object in the key `pings` which contains one or more ping objects.
A ping object contains three keys as shown in the example: `start`, `length`, and `highlight`.
While not currently used, these values are used to indicate if a message should highlighted as a ping and what section in it if so.

## Chat Markdown

Markdown processing in chat is backed by [pxls-markdown](https://github.com/pxlsspace/pxls-markdown), which uses [unified](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified), [remark-parse](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/master/packages/remark-parse) and a combination of custom plugins to handle __underlines__, @mentions, :emoji: ðŸ˜„, etc; as well as converting the syntax tree into DOM elements.

The [Processor](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#processors) is exposed in `App.chat.markdownProcessor`. You can extend its functionality by creating a [Plugins](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#plugin) and doing `App.chat.markdownProcessor.use(yourPlugin)`.

You can read more on how the processor works on [unified's README](https://github.com/unifiedjs/unified#description) or by [checking the sourcecode of plugins on the pxls-markdown repository](https://github.com/pxlsspace/pxls-markdown/tree/master/plugins).

```js
function myPlugin() {
    const parserProto = this.Parser.prototype;
    const compilerProto = this.Compiler.prototype;

    /*
     * Inject a new inline tokenizer into the Parser (remark-parse)
     */

    // inlineMethods contains a list of parserProto.inlineTokenizers functions to run
    // sequentially. This is why we add the name of our new tokenizer to the beginning, as to
    // avoid any conflicts with other tokenizers.
    parserProto.inlineMethods.splice(0, 0, 'myCustomMarkup');

    parserProto.inlineTokenizers.myCustomMarkup = function tokenizer(eat, value, silent) {
        if (value.startsWith('test')) {
            if (silent) {
                // If in silent mode, we are only asserting that we've found our markup.
                return true;
            }

            // we eat "test" from the input and replace it with a Node of type "myCustomMarkup" and value "test"
            return eat('test')({
                type: 'myCustomMarkup',
                value: 'test'
            });
        }

        return false;
    }
    parserProto.inlineTokenizers.myCustomMarkup.notInLink = true;
    parserProto.inlineTokenizers.myCustomMarkup.locator = function(value, fromIndex) {
        // A tokenizer's locator returns the location of where our markup starts, or -1 if not found,
        // for optimization purposes.
        // * A constant value of -1 will make our tokenizer only run at the beginning of the source string.
        // * A constant value of 0 will generate an infinite loop.
        return value.indexOf('test', fromIndex);
    }

    /*
     * Inject a new visitor into the Compiler (remark-crel)
     */
    compilerProto.visitors.myCustomMarkup = (node, next) => {
        // calling next() will recursively visit all childrens of our node (node.children)
        // or return the value of our node (node.value) if it has no children.

        const style = 'font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;';
        return crel('span', { style }, next())
    };
}

App.chat.markdownProcessor.use(myPlugin);
```

## Global Events

You can listen for various custom $(window) events triggered with the `pxls:` prefix. Note that these are only listen-able with jQuery.

Examples:
```js
$(window).on('pxls:ack:place', (event, x, y) => {
    console.log("Pixel succesfully placed at (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
});

$(window).on('pxls:ack:undo', (event, x, y) => {
    console.log("Pixel succesfully undoed at (" + x + ", " + y + ")");
});

$(window).on('pxls:pixelCounts:update', (event, counts) => {
    console.log("New pixel count: " + counts.pixelCount + " current, " + counts.pixelCountAllTime + " all time");
});


/** Events used internally but still available to anyone **/
$(window).on('pxls:panel:opened', (event, panelDescriptor) => {
    console.log("Opened panel " + panelDescriptor);
});

$(window).on('pxls:panel:closed', (event, panelDescriptor) => {
    console.log("Closed panel " + panelDescriptor);
});

$(window).on('pxls:queryUpdated', (event, propName, oldValue, newValue) => {
    if (oldValue !== newValue) {
        console.log("Query property " + propName + " changed from " + oldValue + " to " + newValue);
    }
});

$(window).on("pxls:user:loginState", function(e, isLoggedIn) {
    console.log(isLoggedIn ? "Client is logged in" : "Client isn't logged in");
})
```

## Localizations

We use [GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) for our localization format. The source files for localizations are located in the `po` directory.

`Localization.pot` is the template file and `Localization*.po` are the localizations for the relevant language.

### Creating a new language localization

Copy `po/Localization.pot` to `po/Localization_$LC$.po` (where `$LC$` is the language [ISO 639-1 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)).

Fill in each empty `msgstr ""` with the translation of the `msgid "..."`. If additional context is needed, open the relevant file(s) (denoted by `#: ...`)
and search for the relevant `msgid` string.

### Compiling localizations

Use the `compile-localizations.js` helper script. This should generate new versions of `resources/Localization*.properties`.

### Generating new localization strings

After creating a new localization string in the code somewhere, it must be added to the `.pot` and `.po` files.

Use the `generate-potfile.js` helper script and the following command to unify it across all `.po` files:

```bash
for f in po/*.po; do msgmerge -N -U --no-wrap $f po/Localization.pot; done
```

## Symbols Template Style

The `Symbols` template style (located in `views/index.handlebars` and localization files between `Dotted (Big, 2:2)` and `"Numbers"`)
uses the reference palette configuration. Any changes to the palette will break this style. To modify it, decode the base64 string for the symbols into a `.png`
and open it in an image editor. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/fQNYgy4.png" alt="Symbols template style sample">

Each symbol is in a 7x7 block going from left to right, top to bottom. The color of the symbols do not matter as they will be re-mapped to the palette when applied.
The symbols can be resized so long as they remain proportional to the image size so that there are two rows of 16 blocks each, or however many colors are in the palette.
Once finished editing, convert the `.png` back into base64 format and replace the option value in `index.html`.

To remove the symbols, delete the `<option value="...">{{i18n('Localization', 'Symbols') | raw}}</option>` from `index.html` and remove or comment out the relevant
localization string from each file in `po/`. Compile localizations with `node compile-localizations.js`.
