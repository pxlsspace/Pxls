Pxls is a collaborative canvas where users can place one pixel from a limited palette at a time, inspired by Reddit's [r/Place][place] experiment.

This repository holds the back end server. The front end can be found [here][frontend].

**Note:** A Docker image is available at [aneurinprice/docker-pxls.space][docker] and on [Docker Hub][dockerhub].

# Installation

Automatically built `pxls*.jar` files are available as artifacts on each push [here][actions].

## Building

The following are required on the **build** system:

* [JDK 16][jdk16]
* [Apache Maven][maven]

The following are required on the **target** system:

* [JRE 16][jdk16]
* [Postgres][postgres]

To build, run `mvn clean package` in the project root.

The built `pxls*.jar` file is available in `target/`.

## Running

Copy the built `pxls*.jar` along with the following (renamed) to the instance directory:

* `reference.conf` (`pxls.conf`)
* `roles-reference.conf` (`roles.conf`)
* `palette-reference.conf` (`palette.conf`)

Edit configuration files as necessary. The following `pxls.conf` keys MUST be configured from default for an instance to run:

* `database.user`
* `database.pass`
* `database.url`
* `host`
* `oauth` (necessary for any form of user authentication)
    * [Reddit][redditapps], [Google][googleconsole], [Discord][discordapps], [VK][vkapps], [Tumblr][tumblrapps], and [CAS applications](https://apereo.github.io/cas/7.0.x/index.html) are current supported.

Run with `java -jar pxls*.jar`

# Notes

* The server will start on port `4567` by default.
* The instance has a [rudimentary console](#console-commands).
* The configuration file uses [HOCON][hocon].
* Unspecified configuration values will use built-in defaults from `resources/reference.conf`.
* Automatic backups of `board.dat` are saved every five minutes to `backups/` in the configured storage directory, as well as before exiting (with `CTRL + C`).
* The `Symbols` template style uses the reference palette configuration. See [here](docs/developer.md#symbols-template-style) to modify or remove.

## Configuring CAPTCHA

CAPTCHAs are disabled by default and must be configured to work.
A [CAPTCHA key and secret][captcha] is needed and the type must be "Invisible reCAPTCHA".

The `host` configuration key must be an approved domain on the reCAPTCHA admin panel. For local testing, this will likely be `localhost` (no port).

An example CAPTCHA section could look like this:

```hocon
host: "example.com"

captcha {
  enabled: false
  // Captcha will show rougly 1/<threshold> times
  threshold: 5
  key: "6LcedG4UAAAAAKA6l9BbRPvZ2vt3lTrCQwz8rfPe"
  secret: "6LcedG4UAAAAAIXZcNFhnLKvTQwG1E8BzQQt_-MR"
  maxPixels: 0
  allTime: true
}
```
